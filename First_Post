Hello there! I'm Mrs. Sujata Dongol. I previously worked as a Web team lead, I have about five years of front-end development experience. I started off as an intern and worked my way up to become a Web Team Lead. My primary responsibility were to build responsive, user-friendly webapps using Angular, Vue, Redux, and React .

I enrolled in the Master's degree in information systems management because I think that  learning never stops and it is  important and I  gain knowledge and skills that will enable me to contribute to the technological community.

I would like to discuss cyberbullying and harassment as  a  traditional crimes that has moved online. Such issues are usually overlooked or not handled properly, preventing victims from accessing support services they require. It is important that these topics are addressed so that people can have safer environments on the internet.

Bullying has been a major problem worldwide. With advancement in technology Traditional bullying has moved from being physical towards online harassment.
There are various tactics involved in traditional bullying, which is done through direct interchanges. For instance:

•⁠ ⁠Physical bullying (Punching or slapping) /  ⁠Verbal bullying  (Insulting or threatening) / Social bullying (Ignoring someone or gossiping about them) 

The outcome of such actions may be anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem.

Bullying has gradually moved online. Cyberbullying is a situation where electronic communication is used to frighten or threaten people.

•⁠ ⁠Harassment (Sending many hostile messages) /  ⁠Impersonation ( Acting like another person on the internet) / ⁠Doxxing ( Sharing private information about others with the purpose of causing harm) / Exclusion (Not allowing someone to be part of certain groups on social media sites)

Cyberbullying unlike traditional bulling can happen at any time victimizing individuals even when they imagine that they are safe.

I think there are a few reasons why crimes are shifting online:

•⁠ ⁠Privacy: Criminals can hide their identities online, which makes it easy for them to conduct crimes. Use of IP blocker/ VPNS

•⁠ Expanded Reach: Use of online platforms allow culprits to target victims from anywhere in the world.

•⁠ ⁠Decreased Risk of Conflict: Since many internet crimes, such as fraud and cyberbullying, don't involve face-to-face contact, the danger to offenders is reduced.

•⁠ ⁠Increased Digital Dependency: As more personal and financial information is stored on the internet, individuals, organizations become susceptible to cybercriminals.

•⁠ ⁠Utilization of Social Media: Scammers and harassers are taking advantage of social media and other digital platforms knowing very well that little oversight exists.

•⁠ ⁠Simplified Execution: Criminals are finding it easier to perpetrate their evil acts using tools available online such as the dark web for engaging in illegal activities.

•⁠ ⁠Regulatory Shortcomings: Many online crimes go unpunished due to jurisdictional issues that arise from a changing internet and difficulties in tracking down culprits involved.

•⁠ ⁠Emotional Distance: The impersonality of computer interactions may diminish empathy making it easier for people to commit hurtful acts.

In order to reduce these crimes, law enforcement agencies as well as policy makers need come up with ways on how to tackle them and thereby make sure that everyone is safe while on the Internet
